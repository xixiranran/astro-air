Today I'll share how I customized my Astro blog theme using Tailwind CSS. The combination of Astro and Tailwind makes styling incredibly efficient.

## Key Customizations

1. **Color Scheme**: Created a custom dark/light mode theme
2. **Typography**: Set up a consistent type scale
3. **Layout**: Implemented responsive design patterns
4. **Components**: Styled reusable UI components

## Tips for Theme Development

- Start with a clear design system
- Use Tailwind's configuration file for custom values
- Leverage CSS variables for dynamic theming
- Test across different devices and screen sizes
