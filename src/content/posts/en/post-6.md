While Astro excels at static site generation, sometimes we need dynamic features. Here's how to add interactivity without sacrificing performance.

## Dynamic Features Added

1. **Search Functionality**: Implemented client-side search
2. **Comment System**: Integrated with a third-party service
3. **Like Button**: Added interactive reactions
4. **View Counter**: Track page views

## Implementation Details

The key is using Astro's partial hydration to only load JavaScript where needed. This keeps the site fast while adding necessary dynamic features.
